# This is a heading
This is some descriptive text

```{r}
# This is a comment
# I loaded some packages here. Now these packages are accessible to the rest of the document.

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

```

# If the PDF doesn't compile...
You may have to install "tinytex.' Un-comment the two lines below and run them with the green triangle on the right. Then re-comment them.

```{r}
#install.packages('tinytex')
#tinytex::install_tinytex()

```

# Here is some fake data

```{r}

a <- 2 # We can use <- to assign values to variables

b <- 1

x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 5, sd=1) # Here, I sampled some random values from a normal distribution and assigned them to the variable x

errors <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd=1) # Same for the errors

y <- a*x+b + errors # I generated fake y values by using the function y = ax + b

data <- tibble(x = x, y = a*x+b + errors) # I created a dataframe to store the fake data

```

We can take a peak at the first few rows using the head() functions
```{r}

head(data) 

```

# This is the histogram of x

```{r}

ggplot(data, aes(x)) + geom_histogram()

```


# This is the scatter plot of the raw data

```{r}

ggplot(data, aes(x,y)) + geom_point()


```

# This is a filtered dataset for x < 5
```{r}
filtered_data <- data %>% filter(x<5)

summary(filtered_data) # We can quickly find some statistics using the summary() function

```

# This is the scatter plot of the filtered data

```{r}

filtered_scatter <- ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x,y)) + geom_point()
filtered_scatter

```

# You can add a line of best fit like so

```{r}

filtered_scatter + geom_abline(slope = a, intercept = b)

```
