## Basic Syntax


```r
# This is a comment. You denote it with #

x # This is a variable. It can store stuff

"x" # This is a string. It is just text

# This is how you assign values to a variable
x <- 1 

```


**This is how you create a vector. You use the notation `c()`**
```r
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
y <- c(1, 2, 3)
z <- 1:3 # This is the same as y. The : indicates a vector from 1 to 3

```


**To choose a specific element of a vector, you can use `[]`**
```r
x[2] # Outputs "b"
y[3] # Outputs 3
x[c(2, 3)] # Outputs "b", "c"
x[1:2] # Outputs "a", "b"

```


**This is how you print values so that they are visible**
```r
print(x)
```

## Doing math



```r
1 + 1
1 - 1
```
2

0



**Adding a single number to a vector**

```r
y + 1 # Adds the single number to all elements in the vector
```
2, 3, 4

**Adding a vector to a vector**
```r
y + z # Adds the 1st to the 1st, the 2nd to the 2nd, etc.

```


2, 4, 6



## Other useful functions

```r
sum(y) # Adds together the elements of y

mean(y) # Takes the mean of the elements of y

2 * 2 # Multiplication

2 / 2 # Division

2^2 # To the power of 2

sqrt(2) # Square root of 2

(2 + 2) * 2 / (2) # Order of operations still apply, remember to use parentheses when you need to


```
